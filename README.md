TypeScript implementation of the Concise Binary Object Representation [RFC 7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049). From the [official website](http://cbor.io/):

CBOR is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.

The API is self-explanatory:
```js
// Initialize some data
const json = {
    "key": "value",
    "another key": [
        1, 2, 3
    ],
    "number": 3.141592653589793
    "nulls are also encoded": null
};

const encoded = CBOR.encode(json); // ArrayBuffer
const decoded = CBOR.decode(encoded); // Object

// You can also encode into a pre-allocated buffer
const encoded = CBOR.encodeInto(new ArrayBuffer(4096), data);
```

### Usage

The library is targeted for both Node and Browsers using NPM:
```
> npm install cbor@npm:jprochazk/cbor
```
This installs the library under the `cbor` alias.

```js
// as CommonJS
const CBOR = require("cbor");

// as an ES module
import CBOR from "cbor";

CBOR.encode(...);
CBOR.decode(...);
```

Or included in the page as a static script from the `unkpg` CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@jprochazk/cbor@0.4.6"></script>
<script>
    // after including the script in the page, the CBOR object is available globally
    CBOR.encode(...);
    CBOR.decode(...);
</script>
```

### Benchmarks

Benchmark is available [here](https://jsbench.me/krkdop8101/1).

| Browser | CBOR.decode | CBOR.encode | CBOR.encodeInto |
| :------ | :---------- | :---------- | :-------------- |
| Chrome  | 5225 ops/s  | 8998 ops/s  | 9268 ops/s      |
| Firefox | 20454 ops/s | 22323 ops/s | 22900 ops/s     |

Results are on a i5-8600k intel processor. Your mileage may vary. The JSON data used in the test is 2 KB decoded and 1.8 KB encoded. I specifically chose this data, because it encodes badly (lots of nested objects with only a single property). The benchmark suggests the library can encode/decode around 10 MB/s in Chrome and around 50 MB/s in Firefox. Hopefully, these are meaningful results.

### Notes

There are a few things from the specification which are currently unimplemented:

-   Tags, and the items they represent:
    -   date/time, bignum/bigfloat as byte string, and others
-   16-bit float (IEEE754 binary16)
-   Integers larger than 32 bit (BigInt)

If you need one or more of these features, submit an [issue](https://github.com/jprochazk/cbor/issues).
